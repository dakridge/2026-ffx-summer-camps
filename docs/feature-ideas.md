# Feature Ideas

Potential features to add to the Summer Camp Explorer.

## High Impact

### Favorites
Save camps to a wishlist using localStorage. Add heart icon on camp cards, and a "View Saved" filter toggle to show only favorited camps.

### Sort Options
Add sorting dropdown with options:
- Price (low to high)
- Price (high to low)
- Date (earliest first)
- Date (latest first)
- Name (A-Z)
- Duration (shortest/longest)

### Calendar View
Third view option (List / Map / Calendar) showing camps on a weekly calendar grid. Helps parents visualize the summer schedule and spot gaps or overlaps.

### Share Filtered Results
"Copy Link" button that copies the current URL with all filter params. Shows toast confirmation when copied.

## Medium Impact

- See all weeks of summer in a grid

### Compare Camps
- Add "Compare" checkbox on camp cards

### Price Per Hour
Show value comparison on camp cards:

- Display as "$X/hr" badge
- Add "Best Value" sort option

### Distance Filter

## Nice to Have
